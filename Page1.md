# About Me!

**Basic Information**

My name is *Livia Fiebelkorn*. I am eighteen years old. I am from Center, Missouri. I am a freshman student at University of Missouri-Columbia. This was my first semester in college and I really enjoyed it. Covid-19 has made it difficult to do schooling, but I am very happy with how well Mizzou handled the virus and never felt unsafe while living on campus. I hope that perhaps next year I will be able to experience what Mizzou is normally like and get to participate in clubs and go to school events.
